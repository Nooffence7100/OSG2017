# The Fortress


## Introduction

#### Inspiration
Inspired by the pixelated, epically large scale mining game called Dwarf Fortress. It's designed to incase the gamer with its exciting yet somewhat endless resource collecting via in game map. However building the user's imagination through allowing them to create their own buidlings. It a game built by craftemenship, that which we will come to create.

#### Direction
Our method of programming will be using the complex yet majestic language C++ to implement the game's structure and game character. Difficult as it may be, It'll  be through using a platform such as codeblock for our Linux users and Windows observes to create this vast world.

## Development Requirements

Language: C++

Platform: CodeBlocks - Linux & Windows

Structure: Maps

### Windows: 

- **CodeBlocks binary** *[download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/16.01/Windows/codeblocks-16.01-setup.exe/download)*

### Ubuntu:

     sudo apt-get codeblocks
     
### SQLite:

- **libsqlite3.a** *[download](https://github.com/covcom/122COM_sql/blob/master/windows/libsqlite3.a?raw=true)*

*Go to compiler settings,  next linker settings then link the "sqlite3.a" file.  In editor choose to work with C++11.*

## Development Notes     

#### Linux: 
- *Its adviced that you don't develop on Linux* 

Part of the code will not work, as there are imports that work only on Windows, hence you'll experience a triggering of an error.  

#### Windows: 
We have developed a game where it stores your infomration in a database through slite. The only fault is that the platform requires a method.
